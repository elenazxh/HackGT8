In the midst of the prolonged global pandemic, 
social order and everyday life were hugely impacted. 
Everyone is wishing for the pandemic to end as 
soon as possible and return to normal life. But the 
responsibility lies on everyone to take healthy initiatives
by paying attention to your own health via wearing masks, getting
vaccinated and doing weekly testings.
To this end of we decided to make a fun and educational game 
about preventing the spread of Covid-19. 
In this visualizable java project, players game against the prevailing virus!
Through different modes, we hope players gain a better understanding of the significant
roles that masks and vaccines play in reducing transmissions amongst crowds and
increase their immune systems to fight against the virus by using different models of Buzz.
It is our honorable duty as Georgia Tech students to spread awareness of epidemic preparedness.
